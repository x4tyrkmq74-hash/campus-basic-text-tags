            <p><strong>Beginning practice with the basic text formatting tags used in HTML5.</strong></p>

            <p><em>Comments are used to add additional information to pages that helps developers working on that code.</em> You can also use a comment to hide content from your page.</p>

            <p>
                When you have text that is displayed in a block, usually with multiple lines, it's considered a paragraph. 
                Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are emphasized in some way, and they can contain links and 
                other markup used for text (but not headings). Paragraphs are block-level elements. It may happen that you have 
                text, like a poem, that requires some special formatting. You'd need to ensure that each line displayed at a proper 
                length, and you can do that with line break tags such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>. Remember that tags like 
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> convey meaning.

            <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>
            <h3>Excerpt from <cite>The Raven - a Poem by Edgar Allen Poe</cite></h3>

            <p>
                Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
                “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this and nothing more."</p>

            <p>
                This poem shows how <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> lines are used only when needed. Tags like 
                <mark>emphasis</mark> and <mark>strong importance</mark> convey meaning. A line break is useful 
                in poetry but not for layout. This is why semantic markup is important for <mark>readability</mark>.

                Sometimes, you are marking up small pieces of text, including single letters and words, to convey meaning. 
                If your page offered search results, you may want to highlight a <mark>focus area</mark> in that text. 
                For example, using <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is preferred for meaning.
            </p>

            <p>
                The primary <b>focus area</b> must be chosen from one of the four GIT focus areas. The secondary focus area 
                can be any topic that will best aid the student's career path. You might also describe text using 
                <i>alternative styling</i> when needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                We used the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags above, but we haven't talked about 
                the underline tag. These are not often used, and can confuse the user as they style text with an 
                underline—the same way that links do by default. A good use for these is to highlight speling errors.
